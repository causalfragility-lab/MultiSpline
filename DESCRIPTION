Description: Provides tools for fitting, predicting, and visualizing nonlinear
    relationships in single-level, multilevel, and longitudinal regression
    models. Flexible functional forms are supported using natural cubic splines
    via 'splines' and smooth terms via 'mgcv'. The package offers a unified
    interface for specifying nonlinear effects, interactions with time
    variables, clustering through random intercepts, and additional linear
    covariates. Utilities are included to generate prediction grids and produce
    effect plots, facilitating interpretation and visualization of nonlinear
    effects in applied regression workflows.
